## Overview

__What's this?__

BSData organisation created this project. It's GitHub repository of datafiles. Maintained by community, in no way endorsed by BattleScribe. If you want to develop - cool! We need you! Take a look at [Getting Started wiki][].

We currently are working on adding all the factions, but it will take some time. It will go a lot faster with some more help, please consider helping out. So maybe we can have an actual working set soon. (No we will not take down the ones up untill we have them all finished.)

__Okay, nice project. Is it actually working?__ _I just want those files..._

Yeah! We have it hosted on AppSpot. Take a look: [BattleScribe Data on Appspot][]
